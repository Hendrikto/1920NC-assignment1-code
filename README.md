# Natural Computing Assignment 1 Code

This repository contains the necessary code required for reproducing the findings from assignment 1.

## Dependencies

The dependencies are tracked with [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv), so to set up the same environment we used, simply run `pipenv sync`.

## Executing Exercises

To execute the code for an exercise, just run the corresponding Python file from the [`src`](src/) directory within the Pipenv environment. For example, to execute exercise 8, run `pipenv run python src/exercise8.py`.
